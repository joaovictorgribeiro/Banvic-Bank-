  - **Data Formats**: Data was extracted in structured formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and, when necessary, through direct database queries via Power BI.

- **Transformation**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Data was cleaned to remove duplicates, correct errors, and ensure consistency.
  - **Standardization**: Values were standardized (e.g., dates, text formats) to facilitate future analyses.
  - **Enrichment**: Data was enriched with additional calculations, such as performance metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs).

- **Loading**:
  - **Data Modeling**: Transformed data was modeled in Power BI using Query Editor and Relationship Editor to create an optimized dimensional model.
  - **Automated Updates**: Configurations were made to ensure that Power BI dashboards and reports are automatically updated with new data at regular intervals.
